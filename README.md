## Requirements and Instalation

<b>1.</b> This app is build as child theme of Beans theme. Therefore as a first step you must install Beans theme.
The GitHub repository can be found here: 

[https://github.com/Getbeans/Beans](https://github.com/Getbeans/Beans)

<b>2.</b> When working with Wordpress REST API you need to install and activate <b>JSON Basic Authentication</b> plugin. The plugin repo could be found on this link: 

[https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth](https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth)

<b>3.</b> To speed up the proceess of coding and structuring the APP I have used a read mady Custom Post Typs (CPT) class by <b>jjgrainger</b> for creating the CPT 'Client'. I have used composer (it was a point on coding task document delivered by artbees). 
The repo for this class can be found here: 

[https://github.com/jjgrainger/wp-custom-post-type-class](https://github.com/jjgrainger/wp-custom-post-type-class)

<b>4.</b> Since with this app a client can use a form and register to  our platform by suing WP REST API there is a need for 
muthentication method. Since it is test project i have used Basic Authentication method. For enterprise usage I strongly advice OAuth2 as Authentication method for WP REST API. For this reason in the child theme directory inside <b>include</b> directory look for a file called <i>ax_at_beas_enqueue_assets.php</i>, on line 23 replace username and password with your user information. 

```
wp_localize_script( 'app_vue_js', 'axAtBeesSettings', array( 'root' => esc_url_raw( rest_url() ), 'nonce' => wp_create_nonce( 'wp_rest' ), 'username'=>'admin', 'passwd' => 'admin' ) );
```

<b>5</b>. The last step is to upload the child theme (ax-at-bees) or clone this repo to your Wordpress theme directory.  

<b>6</b>. After you pass all steps dont forget to update <b>Composer</b>.
